        With indoor dining closed for the foreseeable future, New York City’s coffee shops aren’t the same kind of        community        hubs that they used to be. But traces of pre-pandemic New York are still to be found at many coffee shops and        cafes,        where trivia nights, electrifying cold brew, all-day wine, and free wifi are still on the menu. In fact, many of        the        city’s top roasters are now back open for business, with some offering outdoor patio and backyard seating for        working        (away) from home during the pandemic.
